|Project compiles and builds without warnings or errors                                    |Partial. Sometimes a dict error.                              |

|CAS, CCS swithces has a frame queue, and reads/writes appropriately                       |Partial. CCS does not have a frame queue.                     |
|CAS/CCS allows multiple connections                                                       |Complete                                                      |

|CAS/CCS learns destinations and doesn't forward packet to any port except the one required|Partial. Somtimes forwards ack frames and to the sending node.|
|CAS receives local firewall rules                                                         |Complete. Done through a global list.                         |
|CAS forwards traffic and ACKs properly                                                    |Partial. Seems to sometimes forward ACKs to other nodes.      |
|CCS switch opens the firewall file and gets the rules                                     |Complete                                                      |

|CCS does the global firewalls                                                             |Complete.                                                     |

|Nodes open their input files and save data that they received                             |Partial. They seem to save ack frames as well.                |
|Nodes will sometimes drop acknowledgement                                                 |Missing.                                                      |
|Nodes will sometimes create erroneous frame                                               |Missing.                                                      |

# KNOWN BUGS #
1) Sometimes there is an error where the dict changes while it is being traversed. It is not consistent.
2) Sometimes nodes seem to save ack/empty frames, as well as flood frames that include themselves.
3) Either some nodes aren't connected by the time they need to receive and the frame gets lost in global transit, or the node disconnects before it can properly receive it.
4) If there is no file for an AS to read from, it sometimes doesn't compile correctly. Uncertain if this is needed to be accounted for.
